    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Mike and I am currently learning HTMl and this is one of my first blogs I have created.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently I am working in a finance department, but I would like to switch to an IT department within my company.

        In my freetime I enjoy to play soccer and I love to go for a hike on the weekend.
